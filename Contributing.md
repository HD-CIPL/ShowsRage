# Contributing to *ShowsRage*

You can contribute to *ShowsRage* in various ways. Any kind of contribution is welcome.

## Use and share the application

The easiest contribution you can do. What is the purpose of an application that has no users? :smile:

## Report bugs

If you find something that is broken in the application, I will do my best to fix it in the next version.

Here are a few tips to take into account, before [creating a new issue](https://github.com/MGaetan89/ShowsRage/issues/new):

- Make sure that you are using the latest version of the application. Maybe the bug is already fixed
- Make sure that the issue was not [already reported](https://github.com/MGaetan89/ShowsRage/issues)
- Provide as many details as possible:
 - How to reproduce the issue?
 - What is the expected behaviour?
 - What is your device and Android version?

## Suggest new features

Do you have an amazing idea that you would like to see in *ShowsRage*? [Tell me](https://github.com/MGaetan89/ShowsRage/issues/new) about it, and maybe it will find its way into a future version of the application.

## Translate the application

While not everything in the application can be translated (for example, the show/episode plots), I tried to internationalize as much as possible.

*ShowsRage* is currently available in [English](https://github.com/MGaetan89/ShowsRage/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) and [French](https://github.com/MGaetan89/ShowsRage/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values-fr/strings.xml). If you wish, and are able, to see *ShowsRage* in your language, feel free to [submit a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) with the appropriate changes.
