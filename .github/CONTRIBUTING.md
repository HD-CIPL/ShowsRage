## Bug Report

It is possible that you find a bug while using *ShowsRage*. To help me fix it as fast as possible, try to provide as many information as you can when [creating an issue](https://github.com/MGaetan89/ShowsRage/issues/new). Also make sure that the issue was not yet reported.

## New Feature

If you think that something is missing from *ShowsRage*, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/MGaetan89/ShowsRage/issues/new) to explain it. As for bug report, try to give as many detail as you can.

## Translation

While not everything can be translated, *ShowsRage* aim to localized as much as possible.

You can contribute to *ShowsRage* translations on [localise.biz](https://localise.biz/mgaetan89/showsrage). If you wish to add a new language, just [create an issue](https://github.com/MGaetan89/ShowsRage/issues/new) with the language you want to add.

The following languages are currently supported:
- [English](https://github.com/MGaetan89/ShowsRage/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml)
- [French](https://github.com/MGaetan89/ShowsRage/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values-fr/strings.xml)

If you don't want to use [localise.biz](https://localise.biz/mgaetan89/showsrage), you can submit a new translation here, on GitHub. To do so, copy one of the above file into its own localized folder, and translate it. You can add it in the list above and update the `resConfigs` field in [`app/build.gradle`](https://github.com/MGaetan89/ShowsRage/blob/master/app/build.gradle).

Once ready, send a new Pull Request so it can be included in the next version of *ShowsRage*.
